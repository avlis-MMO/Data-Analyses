# Introduction
This python script will read the data from the data set and clean it, and then i will present the euro exchange rate compared to other 12 currencies since 2000 to 2022.
It will show a figure with 12 plots, it isnt possible to show all in the same plot cause the scale of the korean won is much higher than the other currencies
